# 2024 US Election Sentiment Analysis on X (formerly Twitter) 🇺🇸🗳️

This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to perform Sentiment Analysis on election-related tweets from X (formerly Twitter). The model is based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) ideal for handling sequence data like text.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Sentiment Classification: Analyzes tweets to predict sentiment towards various candidates or topics during the 2024 US Election.
LSTM Model: The model is trained to classify tweets into categories like positive, neutral, or negative.
Model and History Saved: The trained model and its training history have been saved and are available in this repository for further analysis or re-use.
🔧 Technologies Used:

TensorFlow
Keras
LSTM (Deep Learning)
Pandas (Data Manipulation)
Matplotlib (Visualization)
📂 Files Included:

model.h5: The saved model.
training_history.json : The training history (accuracy/loss over epochs).
